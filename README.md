# MovieRecommender
Basic script using Python that recommends a movie from the top IMDB 500 movies, based on movies that I have watched on Kodi (.db file created from WatchedList). Recommendation made using Genres and Directors information, movies can be filtered by language. 

# Update 1
Unfortunately the OMDB API is no longer working for free users so this script is broken.
